# Stalin's War: A Radical New Theory of the Origins of the Second World War by Ernst Topitsch
 
Stalin's War is a book by Ernst Topitsch, a German philosopher and historian, that challenges the conventional view of the causes and course of World War II.

Topitsch bases his theory on a careful analysis of Soviet documents, diplomatic records, and military intelligence. He claims that Stalin manipulated Hitler into invading Poland in 1939, hoping to trigger a general war that would weaken the Western powers and allow the Soviet Union to expand its influence. He also contends that Stalin was preparing a massive offensive against Germany in 1941, but was preempted by Hitler's Operation Barbarossa.
 
Topitsch's book is a provocative and controversial contribution to the historiography of World War II. It challenges the orthodox view that Stalin was a reluctant ally of the West, and that Hitler was solely responsible for unleashing the war. It also offers a new perspective on the role of ideology, strategy, and geopolitics in shaping the course of history.
